Once a category is selected the user can start to guess what pokemon is shown. If guessed correct the user's score will increase by 1 and the user can use the Next button to guess another pokemon. If the user can not guess the pokemon a skip button is available that generates a different pokemon.

The reset button takes the user back to the start screen to select another generation category and sets the score back to 0.
